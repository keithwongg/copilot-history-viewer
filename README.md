# Github CoPilot History Viewer

## Problem
CoPilot Chat History can be exported as `.json`, but there are problems importing it. I wanted a tool to view the chat history but I could not find one.

## Solution
Made a browser only, vanilla js, css, html tool with with CoPilot, Agent: 3.7 Sonnet. No 3rd party dependencies. No data stored on servers.

## How to use
Upload your `chat.json`. Chats by AI are collapsed by default as they can be pretty long.

## Sample
You can download `chat.json` used to generate this tool in this repo, and try uploading it to test this tool out.

## Disclaimer
This tool is only meant to be used as a quick reference. As a result, extremely fine details are lost and parsing to cater for those needs some work.
